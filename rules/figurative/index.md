# Figurative language 

Figurative language is a type of language that uses figures of speech such as metaphor, simile, and personification to create imagery and to convey a deeper meaning. For example, "The sky was a canvas of blue and white" is an example of figurative language as it uses metaphor.

Declarative language is a type of language that makes a statement or a declaration. It is often used to express facts or opinions. For example, "The sky is blue" is an example of a declarative sentence.

"Show, don't tell" is a writing rule that suggests that writers should use descriptive language and actions to reveal emotions and thoughts of characters rather than stating them directly. This way, readers can experience the emotions and thoughts of the characters more vividly.

They do not have a direct common point, but the 'show don't tell' rule is related to the use of descriptive language, and the use of descriptive language is related to the use of figurative language. Both figurative and descriptive language help in creating vivid imagery and conveying emotions, thoughts and ideas. They help writers to paint a picture in the reader's mind and make the story more interesting.
