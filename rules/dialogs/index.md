Can you create example of dialogue to reveal character and advance the plot in situation 'Two friends investigate haunted castle"?

Characters: Alex and Samantha

Alex: "Are you sure we should be doing this, Sam? This place gives me the creeps."

Samantha: "Come on, Alex. You're not scared of a little ghost story, are you? Besides, think of the bragging rights if we can prove it's not haunted."

Alex: "I suppose you're right. But if we see anything, I'm out of here."

Samantha: "Deal. Now let's get moving. I want to check out that west wing they say is the most active."

Alex: "Fine, but I'm staying close. I don't trust this place."

(As they walk through the castle, they begin to hear strange noises and see shadows moving in the corners of their eyes)

Samantha: "Did you hear that? It sounded like whispering."

Alex: "I didn't hear anything. Maybe it's just the wind."

Samantha: "I don't think so. I think we're getting close to something."

Alex: "I don't like this, Sam. I think we should leave."

Samantha: "Just a little further. I want to see if we can find any evidence."

(They continue to explore, and eventually come across a hidden room that reveals a secret history behind the castle's haunting)

Samantha: "Alex, look at this! This journal explains everything. The castle was built on a sacred burial ground, and the spirits are still angry about it."

Alex: "I can't believe it. I guess we should call the authorities and tell them what we found."

Samantha: "Yeah, but first let's take some pictures and get out of here before anything else happens."

In this short dialogue, we learn that Alex is hesitant and scared, while Samantha is more adventurous and determined. The dialogue also reveals that they both are interested in investigating the haunted castle and their interaction advances the plot as they find evidence that explain the reason behind the haunting.
