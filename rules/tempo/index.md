Give me five examples of rule 'Use pacing to control the tempo of the story and to create a sense of anticipation'

- A horror story that begins with eerie, atmospheric scenes before escalating to intense, fast-paced scares and action.

- A romance novel that starts with a slow-paced, sweet courtship before picking up the pace as the relationship becomes more intense and passionate.

- A science fiction story that starts with a slow introduction to the world and characters before increasing the pace as the characters are thrown into a series of high-stakes, action-packed events.

- A historical fiction novel that starts with a slow-paced, detailed description of the setting before increasing the pace as the story moves into the main conflict and events.
