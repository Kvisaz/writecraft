# show dont tell

"Show, don't tell" - это принцип написания, который говорит о том, что лучше показывать читателю события или эмоции через действия и диалоги персонажей, а не рассказывать им о них напрямую. Это может включать использование описательного языка, чтобы помочь читателю воспринимать события и эмоции через ощущения персонажей.

Таким образом, использование описательного языка может быть частью принципа "Show, don't tell", но они не являются одним и тем же.



Show me three examples of rule 'Show, don't tell:'


1. "The sun was shining brightly, but the young girl felt a chill run down her spine as she walked through the dark forest."

Instead of telling the reader that the girl is scared, the sentence shows it through the imagery of the bright sun contrasting with the dark forest and the girl's physical reaction of feeling a chill.

2. "He was angry. His face turned red and his fists clenched tightly."

Instead of telling the reader that the person is angry, the sentence shows it through the description of his physical reaction such as his red face and clenched fists.


3. "She sat on the edge of her bed, her head in her hands, tears streaming down her face"

Instead of telling the reader that she is sad, the sentence shows it through the imagery of her sitting on the edge of her bed with her head in her hands and tears streaming down her face.

In each of these examples, the writer uses descriptive language and imagery to show the reader the emotions and actions of the characters, rather than telling them directly. This allows the reader to experience the story and the characters in a more immersive and engaging way.

```
1. Детектив проснулся от звука дождя, который стучал по оконной раме, и вздохнул, растягивая медленно болящие мышцы. Он дотянулся до своего карманного часов на тумбочке, с недовольством отметив время, прежде чем встать с кровати и подойти к раковине.

2. Пока он мочил лицо, детектив не мог смирить ощущение тревоги, которое укреплялось в его животе. Он быстро одевался, надевая свой обычный костюм и плащ-пальто, прежде чем взять свою доверенную лупу и выйти на серый утренний свет.

3. Улицы были пусты, кроме редких колесниц, которые катились мимо, колеса которых капали в лужи, когда детектив шел к полицейскому участку. Как он поднимался по ступеням, он не мог не думать о деле, которое мучило его, о деле, которое

In all three examples you can see how detective is starting his morning routine and how he is feeling, but you don't have a direct statement saying how he feels. Instead, the readers can infer his feelings from his actions and words.

Use rule "show dont tell" to create three examples of morning routine of detective in victorian setting

The detective awoke to the sound of church bells ringing in the distance. He groggily sat up in bed, rubbing the sleep from his eyes before reaching for his pocket watch on the nightstand. As he checked the time, he noticed the thin layer of dust that had accumulated on the watch, a reminder of the gritty, crime-ridden streets he worked on. He sighed, knowing that another long day was ahead of him.

The detective carefully shaved his face, taking extra care not to nick himself with the straight razor. He then donned his formal suit, complete with a waistcoat and bowtie, before sitting down to a small breakfast of toast and tea. As he ate, he read through the morning newspaper, scanning for any news of interest to his investigations.

The detective's eyes slowly opened as the first rays of sun filtered through the window. He lay in bed for a moment, listening to the sounds of horse-drawn carriages and vendors selling their wares on the streets below. He then rose, washed, and dressed in his customary attire, a black suit, white shirt and a bowler hat. As he checked his pocket watch and picked up his magnifying glass, he knew that it was time to begin another day of solving crimes in Victorian London.

Use the rule "Show dont tell" to create three variants of situation:  Young barbarian step in unknown dungeon

"The young barbarian stepped cautiously into the dark and musty dungeon, his hand gripping tightly on the hilt of his sword. The sound of his footsteps echoed in the silence as he scanned the chamber for any sign of danger. He could feel his heart pounding in his chest as he took in the sight of the moss-covered walls and the eerie shadows that seemed to dance on the floor."

"With a fierce roar, the young barbarian charged into the unknown dungeon, his battle axe raised high. The air was thick with the smell of damp stone and the sound of his own breathing. He could feel the adrenaline pumping through his veins as he took in the sight of the cobweb-covered arches and the flickering torchlight that illuminated the chamber."

"The young barbarian crept into the unknown dungeon, his eyes adjusting to the dim light. Every step he took was measured and quiet, as he listened for any sign of danger. He could feel the rough stone walls under his fingers and the chill of the air on his skin as he scanned the chamber for any traps or obstacles."

In each of these examples, the writer uses descriptive language and imagery to show the reader the emotions, actions, and setting of the young barbarian as he steps into the unknown dungeon, rather than telling them directly. This allows the reader to experience the story in a more immersive and engaging way.
